# YAC8E (Yet another chip8 emulator)

## Intro:

As a learning experience I'm trying to make [chip8](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#0.0) interpreter/emulator using C and SDL for the graphics.

## Building:
* **On linux/unix based system:** Install SDL using your package manager and run 
    make unix
* **On Windows**: Install minGw and add the bin folder to your path, download [MinGw dev-library of SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and extract them in C:\mingw_dev_libs (or anywhere you want, just remember to edit makefile.win), then run 
    make win

## Precompiled Binaries
